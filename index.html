  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to the official home of App Cloner.

Using App Cloner you can create and install multiple copies of your existing apps.

App Cloner is the only multi-account app that creates true, independent, installable clones.

Follow @AppCloner on Twitter https://twitter.com/AppCloner to get notified about new features and updates.

DESCRIPTION

Please read about the incompatibilities below. You can get in touch at support@appcloner.app. We're happy to provide support and answer your questions.

Cloned apps run in parallel and work independently from their original apps. They will not receive automatic updates so you can keep and run a stable version alongside the original app.

App cloning can be useful to simultaneously use multiple logins in apps such as Facebook, Instagram or Twitter but the real fun starts by messing around with an app. App Cloner offers a multitude of modding options to tweak the new app copy.

You can change the app name and icon. You can remove permissions or allow a cloned app to be installed on the SD-card. You can disable auto-start and wake locks. Or convert your app into a floating window app.

App Cloner can extend a cloned app to add functionality such as password protection, incognito mode, hiding the Android ID or spoofing locations. You can also force the app to consume data over Wi-Fi only. There are over 100 app customization options and each update will add more.

INCOMPATIBILITIES

Not all apps can be cloned! Cloned apps may crash, show errors or work incorrectly.

Features that depend on the app certificate like Google logins, Google Play Services, Google Play Games, Google Drive backup or in-app purchases WILL NOT WORK!

Cloning an app will change its certificate, which means the clone may not work in case the app validates the certificate or uses advanced copy-protection.

Some apps that CANNOT be cloned:

• AliExpress
• Dana
• eBay (still works before Android 8.0)
• Evernote
• GCash
• Grab
• Kodi
• Lazada
• LINE (LINE 8.11.0 still works)
• OneDrive
• Pokemon GO
• Skype for Business
• Snapchat
• Trello
• Viber (only Viber 7.9.6.22 works)
• WeChat
• WhatsApp (please clone GBWhatsApp or YoWhatsApp instead)
• Most Google apps (however, Chrome, Gmail & YouTube work fine with some limitations)
• Most Microsoft apps (however, Skype & LinkedIn work fine)

Use 'Report app issue' to report a problem with a cloned app.

To install the clones from your device you need to enable Settings > Security > Unknown sources. If the Install button is disabled or doesn't click, you must temporarily disable overlay apps such as chat heads, blue light filters or floating widgets.

You can enable the App Cloner Install Service to fully automate app installations (see Settings).

Anti-virus apps may show warnings for cloned apps. These warnings are false positives and can be ignored. They are caused by the unofficial certificate used to sign clones.

The premium version supports 20 clones. You may donate to support development and unlock up to 1000 clones. All donations & the commercial use package require the premium version. Some more intrusive options and features are linked to certain donations. Larger donations do not include smaller donations or premium.
